        <p>I participated in a one-week intensive software development bootcamp at WeThinkCode, focusing on hands-on coding, problem-solving, and real-world projects using Python.
            During the bootcamp, I gained experience in Python fundamentals and advanced concepts, building projects such as Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard, Tower of Hanoi, and Tic Tac Toe using Visual Studio Code.</p>
